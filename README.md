-Short historical review.

Once upon a time, about 20 years ago, we began exploring the WRT world. 
 Wonderful school, people with imagination, rich of topics and bibliography.
 
The kick start was made by Linksys with the innovative hardware board wrt-54g.

Later, after a successfull entrance to the open source world, Linksys manufactures a new generation of non-industrial routerboards.

It is worth noticing its computing power. When humanity landed on the moon, we did not have as much power.

Of course after testing all kinds of firmware we noticed that the wild horse is hiding and remains a kind good horse. 
 Especially, WRT teams in particular have done a great job at this, pioneers in this field..!
  So let's seek for the wild spirit of the horse ...

The basis of open source is Linux, especially Debian OS, but of course other linux distros can be credited aswell.
 Kali-linux is another distro, Debian's based, made for network analysis, penetration, and much more.
 
And now the question ....?
 Can we awake the wild spirit of this horse called WRT-3200 ACM ?
 
Finally, the answer is YES..!
 and the trip begins...                    
                 
The initial idea started after an innocent, childish and strange idea of a small teenage gamer.
 Afterwards the idea evolved from people with passion.

-Tests and measurements:
The final testers are a group of teenage gamers, you should know they have alot of requests and comments, in general they are very demanding.
Of course we, as older/adults, are still learning..!

With few words: 
 Linksys WRT-3200 ACM + Kali-linux OS = Full Functionality and Software management, Without Limitation on Hardware Capabilities.
   After conversion became a strange unit, impossible to stop working, forget the sticking or even a bricked hardware board.
    Possibility of double boot. Recommended for easy maintenance. 
     Installation contains: 1st partition the Zeus_WRT, 2nd partition the famous DD-WRT.
      Administration's unit take place through: Remote Desktop, Web-interface, ssh, like a simple computer. .  
       Both OS/firmwares have been allready precofigured, all you have to do just set credentials given from your ISP Provider.
